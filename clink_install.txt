Usage

There are several ways to start Clink.

    If you installed the auto-run, just start cmd.exe. Run clink autorun --help for more info.
    To manually start, run the Clink shortcut from the Start menu (or the clink.bat located in the install directory).
    To establish Clink to an existing cmd.exe process, use <install_dir>\clink inject.

Starting Clink injects it into a cmd.exe process, where it intercepts a handful of Windows API functions so that it can replace the prompt and input line editing with its own Readline-powered enhancements.
